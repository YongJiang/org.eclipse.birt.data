This package contains classes that implement the JDBC-ODA Bridge Driver. 
<p>
ODA (Open Data Access) is the standard data extension protocol for providing external
data access to BIRT. The JDBC-ODA Bridge Driver translates ODA API requests to JDBC
calls, thus enabling access to JDBC data sources in BIRT reporting.
